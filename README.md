# NYC Citibike Data Analysis in Tableau
Analysis of August 2019 data from NYC's public use bike service Citibike


### Overview of Analysis
Analysis of Citibike's data in New York City in order to present data for a possible Citibike start up in the city of Des Moines, IA.  Data includes user age, gender, usertype (subscription, pay-per-use), trip durations, start station data, and end station data.

Results
Analysis of August 2019 data shows several clear findings:


Most trips are rather short, the average trip lasts around 5 minutes, most trips don't usually last past 30 minutes.

One could purport that most trips are used to commute to and from work and for leisure on Saturdays to get around as most of the usage is seen around 8 am - 9 am, and 5 pm - 6 pm on weekdays, and during daylight hours on Saturday

And once again we find mostly males are commuting and riding leisurely

# Summary
Citibike's main demographic seems to be male subscribers commuting to and from work as well as Saturday leisure riding mostly on the Manhattan island. This is limited to August of 2019 and obtaining data for an entire year could or could not heavily skew this data. There were some outlandish outliers with certain data particularly in the age data. 
Most importantly, the island of Manhattan is very easy to get around on bicycle and one could live in NYC with out ever having to own a car.  This would explain the high subscriber rate and the high activity for this location.  If Des Moines was engineered in very similar way to Manhattan, then with the given data, it would succeed in that city.
